## Exercises:

1. Give a recursive definition of the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ that
   contain at least one $b$ and have an even number of $a$’s before the
   first $b$.
   For example: $aab$, $bab$ and $aaaabbabababa$ are in the set,
   but $abb$, $aaab$ and $aa$ are not.

   _**SOLUTION:**_

   1. **Basis:**: $b \in L$
   2. **Recursive step:** If $u \in L$ then $aau \in L$ and $bu \in L$.
   3. **Closure:** A string $u \in L$ only if it can be obtained from the
      basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step, and it contains at least one $b$ and has an even number of $a$’s before the first $b$.

2. Let $X = \{aa, bb\}$ and $Y = \{\lambda, b, ab\}$.

   a. List the strings in set $XY$

   _**Answer:**_

   | #   | string | #   | string | #   | string   |
   | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | -------- |
   | 1   | $aa$   | 2   | $aab $ | 3   | $ aaab $ |
   | 4   | $bb$   | 5   | $bbb $ | 6   | $ bbab $ |

   b. How many strings of length 6 are there in $X^*$?

   _**Answer:**_ the number of strings of length 6 in $X^*$ is **8** since 2 (possible strings) to the power of 3 (combinations of $X^*$ that are of length 6) is 8.

   Considering that combinations of $X^*$ that are of length 6 can be obtained from $X^3$ (the cartesian product of $X \times X \times X$), thus:

   $$X^2 = \{aaaa, aabb, bbaa, bbbbb\}$$

   $$X^3 = X^2 × X = \{aaaaaa, aaaabb, aabbaa, aabbbb, bbaaaa, bbaabb, bbbbbaa, bbbbbb\}$$

   $$|X^3| = 8$$

   c. List the strings in set $Y^*$ of length three or less

   _**Answer:**_ Following the same logic as in the previous question:

   <!-- $$Y^2 = \{b, ab, bb, bab, abb, abab\}$$ -->

   <!-- | #   | string    | #   | string | #   | string | -->
   <!-- | --- | --------- | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | -->
   <!-- | 1   | $\lambda$ | 2   | $b $   | 3   | $ ab $ | -->
   <!-- | 4   | $aab$     | 5   | $bab $ | 6   | $ ba $ | -->

   d. List the strings in set $X^* Y^*$ of length four or less

   _**Answer:**_

   <!-- | #   | string | #   | string | #   | string | -->
   <!-- | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | -->
   <!-- | 1   | λ      | 2   | b      | 3   | ab     | -->
   <!-- | 4   | bb     | 5   | abb    | 6   | abab   | -->
   <!-- | 7   | bab    | 8   | bbab   | 9   | abbb   | -->
   <!-- | 10  | aabb   | 11  | aaba   | 12  | aabl   | -->
   <!-- | 13  | bbaa   | 14  | bbab   | 15  | bbl    | -->

3. Give a recursive definition of the set $\{ a^ib^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 2i\}$

   _**SOLUTION:**_

   - **Basis**: $λ \in L$
   - **Recursive Step**: If $w = a^ib^j \in L$, then $a^{i+1}b^j \in L$ and $a^ib^{j+1} \in L$
   - **Closure**: A string $w \in L$ only if it can be obtained from the
     basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step.

4. Let $L$ be the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ generated by the recursive definition:

   **I. Basis:** $b \in L$

   **II. Recursive Step**: If $u \in L$ then $ub \in L$, $uab \in L$, $uba \in
    L$ and $bua \in L$

   **III. Closure**: A string $u \in L$ only if it can be obtained from the
   basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step.

   **a.** List the elements in the sets $L_0, L_1, L_2$

   _**Answer:**_

   Considering that $L_0$ is the set of strings that come from the basis, applying cero recursions, we have that:

   $$L_0 = \{b\} \text{ (the basis)}$$

   Now, considering that $L_1$ is the set of strings that come from the basis, applying one recursion, we can consider the following cases:

   1. $ub | u = b \rightarrow b b \in L_1$
   2. $uab | u = b \rightarrow b ab \in L_1$
   3. $uba | u = b \rightarrow b ba \in L_1$
   4. $bua | u = b \rightarrow b b a \in L_1$ (same as the previous case)

   Thus, we have that:

   $$L_1 = \{bb, bab, bba\} \text{ (basis + recursive step)}$$

   Finally, considering that $L_2$ is the set of strings that come from the basis, applying two recursions, we can consider the following cases (where $u$ = $bb, bab, bba$):

   For $u = bb$:

   1. $ub | u = bb \rightarrow bb b \in L_2$
   2. $uab | u = bb \rightarrow bb ab \in L_2$
   3. $uba | u = bb \rightarrow bb ba \in L_2$
   4. $bua | u = bb \rightarrow b bb a \in L_2$ (same as previous case)

   For $u = bab$:

   1. $ub | u = bab \rightarrow bab b \in L_2$
   2. $uab | u = bab \rightarrow bab ab \in L_2$
   3. $uba | u = bab \rightarrow bab ba \in L_2$
   4. $bua | u = bab \rightarrow b bab a \in L_2$

   For $u = bba$:

   1. $ub | u = bba \rightarrow bba b \in L_2$
   2. $uab | u = bba \rightarrow bba ab \in L_2$
   3. $uba | u = bba \rightarrow bba ba \in L_2$
   4. $bua | u = bba \rightarrow b bba a \in L_2$

   Thus, we have that:

   $$L_2 = \{bbb, bbab, bbba, babb, babab, babba, bbaba, bbaab, bbbaa\} \text{ (basis + 2x recursive step)}$$

   **b.** Is the string $bbaaba$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced.
   If not, explain why not.

   _**Answer:**_

   $$bbaaba \notin L$$

   Analyzing the string we can observe that there are two "a" characters in a row, which is not allowed by the definition of $L$, due to the fact that no recursive step (applied to the basis) can produce a string with two consecutive "a" characters.

   **c.** Is the string $bbaaaabb$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced. If not, explain why not.

   _**Answer:**_

   $$bbaaaabb \notin L$$

   Analogus to the previous answer, it is not possible to produce a string with two consecutive "a" characters, so the string "bbaaaabb" is not in $L$, since it contains the substring "aa".

5. Prove, using induction on the length of a string, that $(w^R)^R = w$ for all
   string $w \in \Sigma$

   _**SOLUTION:**_
